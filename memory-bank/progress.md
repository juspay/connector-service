## Recent Major Updates

### Memory Bank Documentation Overhaul (Latest)

**Completed**: Comprehensive verification and correction of memory bank documentation against actual codebase.

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Accuracy Verification**: All documentation verified against actual protobuf definitions and implementation
2. **Critical Corrections**: Fixed major inaccuracies in API contract documentation
3. **Implementation Status**: Added clear markers for incomplete vs. fully implemented features
4. **Connector Count**: Corrected from 2 to 6 production-ready connectors
5. **Service Architecture**: Verified three-service gRPC architecture documentation

**Files Updated**:
- `grpc_contract.md`: Fixed PaymentMethod structure, added Health service, marked incomplete features
- `payment_flows.md`: Corrected flow types, added implementation status, fixed webhook documentation
- `activeContext.md`: Updated with actual connector count and current project status

**Impact**: Memory bank now provides accurate, evidence-based information for development and integration decisions.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling Consistency**
   - **Issue**: Error handling is not entirely consistent across all components
   - **Impact**: May lead to confusing error messages or incorrect error handling
   - **Status**: In progress

2. **Type Conversion Complexity**
   - **Issue**: The type conversion system between gRPC, domain, and connector types is complex
   - **Impact**: Makes adding new features or connectors more difficult than necessary
   - **Status**: Under review

3. **Documentation Gaps**
   - **Issue**: Some areas of the codebase lack comprehensive documentation
   - **Impact**: Makes it harder for new contributors to understand the system
   - **Status**: Ongoing improvement

4. **Test Coverage**
   - **Issue**: Some components have limited test coverage
   - **Impact**: Increases risk of regressions when making changes
   - **Status**: Ongoing improvement

### Functional Limitations

1. **Missing Major Market Connectors**
   - **Issue**: 6 connectors implemented but missing key players (Stripe, PayPal, Square)
   - **Impact**: Limits market coverage despite solid foundation
   - **Status**: Stripe and PayPal are high priority implementations

2. **Payment Method Restrictions**
   - **Issue**: Limited support for alternative payment methods beyond cards
   - **Impact**: Doesn't meet the needs of users in regions where alternative methods are common
   - **Status**: Planned expansion

3. **Incomplete Dispute Operations**
   - **Issue**: PaymentService.Dispute and DisputeService.Get return placeholder responses
   - **Impact**: Limited dispute management capabilities for some workflows
   - **Status**: Implementation pending

4. **Authentication Mechanism**
   - **Issue**: No built-in authentication for client requests
   - **Impact**: Requires external authentication solution
   - **Status**: By design (service focuses on core functionality)
