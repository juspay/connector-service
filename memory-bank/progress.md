## Known Issues

### Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling Consistency**
   - **Issue**: Error handling is not entirely consistent across all components
   - **Impact**: May lead to confusing error messages or incorrect error handling
   - **Status**: In progress

2. **Type Conversion Complexity**
   - **Issue**: The type conversion system between gRPC, domain, and connector types is complex
   - **Impact**: Makes adding new features or connectors more difficult than necessary
   - **Status**: Under review

3. **Documentation Gaps**
   - **Issue**: Some areas of the codebase lack comprehensive documentation
   - **Impact**: Makes it harder for new contributors to understand the system
   - **Status**: Ongoing improvement

4. **Test Coverage**
   - **Issue**: Some components have limited test coverage
   - **Impact**: Increases risk of regressions when making changes
   - **Status**: Ongoing improvement

### Functional Limitations

1. **Limited Connector Support**
   - **Issue**: Only Adyen and Razorpay are currently implemented
   - **Impact**: Limits the utility of the service for many potential users
   - **Status**: Planned expansion

2. **Payment Method Restrictions**
   - **Issue**: Limited support for alternative payment methods beyond cards
   - **Impact**: Doesn't meet the needs of users in regions where alternative methods are common
   - **Status**: Planned expansion

3. **Multi-step Flow Handling**
   - **Issue**: Some complex payment flows require state management not built into the service
   - **Impact**: Clients must handle state management for these flows
   - **Status**: Under consideration

4. **Authentication Mechanism**
   - **Issue**: No built-in authentication for client requests
   - **Impact**: Requires external authentication solution
   - **Status**: By design (service focuses on core functionality)

2. **Contributors**: Developers interested in adding support for additional payment processors
3. **Feedback**: Feature requests and bug reports from the community

### Lessons Learned

1. **Connector Diversity**
   - Payment processors have widely varying APIs and capabilities
   - A flexible abstraction layer is essential for handling this diversity

2. **Type System Complexity**
   - Converting between different type systems (gRPC, domain, connector) is complex
   - A well-designed type conversion system is critical for maintainability

3. **Error Handling Importance**
   - Payment processing involves many potential error cases
   - Clear, consistent error handling is essential for reliability

4. **Documentation Value**
   - Good documentation is crucial for both users and contributors
   - Examples and clear guides significantly improve adoption

5. **Testing Challenges**
   - Testing payment flows often requires mock servers or test accounts
   - A comprehensive testing strategy is essential for reliability
