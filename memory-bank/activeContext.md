# Active Context: Connector Service

## Current Implementation Status

The Connector Service is currently in a functional state with the following key components implemented:

1. **Core gRPC Server**: The gRPC server is fully implemented with support for all defined payment operations.

2. **Connector Integration Framework**: The trait-based connector integration framework is complete and ready for new connector implementations.

3. **Domain Types**: Common data structures and type conversions are implemented for all supported payment flows.

4. **Client SDKs**: Basic client SDKs are available for Node.js, Python, and Rust.

5. **Example Implementations**: Example clients are provided to demonstrate usage of the service.

## Implemented Connectors

The service currently has implementations for the following payment processors:

1. **Adyen**: Implemented with support for:
   - Authorization
   - Capture
   - Refund
   - Void
   - Webhooks
   - Disputes

2. **Razorpay**: Implemented with support for:
   - Authorization
   - Capture
   - Refund
   - Status checks
   - Webhooks

## Supported Payment Flows

The following payment flows are currently supported:

1. **Authorization**: Authorize a payment without capturing funds
2. **Capture**: Capture previously authorized funds
3. **Sale**: Authorize and capture funds in a single operation
4. **Refund**: Refund previously captured funds
5. **Void**: Cancel a previously authorized payment
6. **Payment Sync**: Check the status of a payment
7. **Refund Sync**: Check the status of a refund
8. **Webhook Processing**: Process webhooks from payment processors
9. **Mandate Setup**: Set up payment mandates for recurring payments
10. **Dispute Handling**: Accept and manage disputes

## Recent Changes

Recent development work has focused on:

1. **Webhook Standardization**: Improving the webhook processing framework to handle different webhook formats consistently.

2. **Error Handling**: Enhancing error reporting and handling across the service.

3. **Type Conversion Improvements**: Refining the type conversion system for better reliability and maintainability.

4. **Documentation**: Expanding documentation for both users and contributors.

5. **Testing**: Adding more comprehensive tests for existing functionality.

## Current Focus Areas

The current development focus is on:

1. **Connector Expansion**: Adding support for more payment processors.

2. **Payment Method Coverage**: Expanding support for different payment methods beyond basic card payments.

3. **SDK Enhancement**: Improving the client SDKs with better documentation and examples.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.

5. **Error Handling**: Continuing to improve error handling and reporting.

## Known Issues

1. **Limited Connector Support**: Only Adyen and Razorpay are currently implemented, limiting the service's utility.

2. **Payment Method Restrictions**: Limited support for alternative payment methods beyond cards.

3. **Documentation Gaps**: Some areas of the codebase lack comprehensive documentation.

4. **Testing Coverage**: Some components have limited test coverage.

5. **Error Handling Consistency**: Error handling is not entirely consistent across all components.

## Next Steps

### Short-term (1-3 months)

1. **Add Stripe Connector**: Implement support for Stripe, one of the most widely used payment processors.

2. **Expand Payment Methods**: Add support for more payment methods, such as:
   - Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
   - Bank transfers
   - Buy Now Pay Later options

3. **Improve Documentation**: Enhance documentation for:
   - API usage
   - Connector implementation
   - SDK integration

4. **Increase Test Coverage**: Add more tests, especially for edge cases and error scenarios.

5. **Enhance Example Implementations**: Provide more comprehensive examples for different use cases.

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

1. **Add More Connectors**: Implement support for additional payment processors:
   - PayPal
   - Checkout.com
   - Braintree
   - Regional processors

2. **Advanced Payment Flows**: Add support for more complex payment scenarios:
   - Multi-step authentication
   - Partial captures and refunds
   - Recurring payments

3. **Performance Improvements**: Optimize the service for higher throughput and lower latency.

4. **Monitoring and Observability**: Enhance logging, metrics, and tracing for better operational visibility.

5. **SDK Expansion**: Develop SDKs for additional programming languages.

### Long-term (6+ months)

1. **Comprehensive Connector Coverage**: Implement support for a wide range of payment processors globally.

2. **Advanced Features**: Add support for:
   - Fraud detection integration
   - Subscription management
   - Payment optimization

3. **Enterprise Features**: Develop features for enterprise users:
   - Advanced reporting
   - Compliance tools
   - High availability configurations

4. **Community Growth**: Foster a community of contributors to maintain and expand the service.

5. **Integration Ecosystem**: Build integrations with complementary services and platforms.

## Current Challenges

1. **Connector Diversity**: Different payment processors have vastly different APIs, authentication methods, and capabilities, making standardization challenging.

2. **Payment Flow Complexity**: Some payment flows involve multiple steps and state management, which can be difficult to model in a stateless service.

3. **Error Handling**: Payment processors return errors in different formats and with different meanings, requiring careful normalization.

4. **Authentication Variety**: Different authentication schemes used by payment processors need to be supported and properly secured.

5. **Testing Complexity**: Testing payment flows often requires mock servers or test accounts for each supported processor.

## Development Priorities

1. **Reliability**: Ensure the service handles errors gracefully and provides clear error messages.

2. **Extensibility**: Make it easy to add new connectors and payment flows.

3. **Performance**: Optimize for low latency and high throughput.

4. **Security**: Handle sensitive payment data securely and follow best practices.

5. **Usability**: Provide clear documentation and easy-to-use SDKs.

## Contribution Opportunities

Areas where contributions would be particularly valuable:

1. **New Connectors**: Implementing support for additional payment processors.

2. **Payment Methods**: Adding support for alternative payment methods.

3. **Documentation**: Improving and expanding documentation.

4. **Testing**: Adding more tests and improving test coverage.

5. **Client SDKs**: Developing and improving client SDKs for different languages.

6. **Examples**: Creating example implementations for different use cases.

7. **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.
