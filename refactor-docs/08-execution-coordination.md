# Execution Coordination & Task Management

## Overview
This document provides the coordination framework for executing the proto interface refactor across multiple sub-agents working in parallel. It defines dependencies, handoff procedures, communication protocols, and risk management strategies.

## Execution Strategy

### Parallel Execution Model
The refactor is designed for **maximum parallelization** within each phase while maintaining strict **sequential dependencies between phases**. This approach minimizes total execution time while ensuring proper coordination.

   - Unblock dependencies
   - Coordinate handoffs
   - Assign urgent help

### Phase Transitions
**Trigger**: When phase completion criteria are met  
**Focus**: Rapid validation and immediate handoff

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Scenarios

#### 1. Proto Compilation Failures
**Risk**: Generated code doesn't compile  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (blocks entire refactor)

**Mitigation**:
- Validate proto syntax early in Phase 1
- Incremental compilation testing
- Backup plan: Rollback to previous proto version

**Escalation**: If compilation issues persist > 4 hours, escalate to coordination lead

#### 2. Performance Regression
**Risk**: New implementation significantly slower  
**Probability**: Low  
**Impact**: High (may require redesign)

**Mitigation**:
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Benchmark against baseline regularly
- Identify bottlenecks early

**Escalation**: If performance regression > 20%, immediate escalation

#### 3. Connector Integration Failures
**Risk**: Connectors don't work with new interfaces  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (payment processing broken)

**Mitigation**:
- Test connector integration incrementally
- Maintain backward compatibility layers
- Have rollback plan ready

**Escalation**: If >50% of connectors fail, escalate immediately

#### 4. Cross-Phase Dependencies Broken
**Risk**: Changes in one phase break previous work  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium (rework required)

**Mitigation**:
- Strict interface contracts between phases
- Regular integration testing
- Version control and rollback capabilities

**Escalation**: If dependencies are broken, coordinate immediate fix

### Risk Monitoring

#### Daily Risk Assessment
Each sub-agent reports daily:
- **Red**: Critical issues blocking progress
- **Yellow**: Issues that may cause delays
- **Green**: On track with no issues

#### Weekly Risk Review
- Review all yellow and red issues
- Update mitigation strategies
- Adjust timelines if necessary
- Escalate persistent issues

### Escalation Matrix

| Issue Type | Response Time | Escalation Level |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Build Failures | 2 hours | Technical Lead |
| Performance Issues | 4 hours | Technical Lead |
| Connector Failures | 1 hour | Product Lead |
| Cross-Agent Blocking | 1 hour | Coordination Lead |
| Timeline Delays | 24 hours | Project Manager |

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 95% for new code
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed by another sub-agent
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must be documented
- **Performance**: No regression > 10%

### Review Process
1. **Self Review**: Sub-agent reviews own work
2. **Peer Review**: Another sub-agent reviews the work
3. **Integration Review**: Coordination lead reviews integration points
4. **Final Review**: All deliverables reviewed before phase sign-off

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: All new functions must have unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Critical paths must have integration tests
- **Performance Tests**: All major components must have benchmarks
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user journeys must be tested

## Communication Framework

### Regular Communications

#### Daily Updates (Required)
- **Time**: End of each work day
- **Format**: Status update in tracking system
- **Content**: Progress, blockers, next day plan

#### Weekly Summary (Required)
