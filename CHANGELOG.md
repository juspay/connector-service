# Changelog

## [2025-01-08] - Billdesk Connector Addition

### Added
- New Billdesk connector implementation for UCS v2
- Payment methods supported: UPI (UpiCollect)
- Transaction flows: Authorize (basic implementation)
- Connector registration in UCS v2 system

### Files Created/Modified
- `src/connectors/billdesk.rs` - Main connector implementation with UCS v2 macro framework
- `src/connectors/billdesk/transformers.rs` - Request/response transformers for Billdesk
- `src/connectors/billdesk/constants.rs` - API constants and endpoints
- `src/connectors.rs` - Added Billdesk connector registration
- `src/types.rs` - Added Billdesk to connector imports and convert_connector function
- `backend/domain_types/src/connector_types.rs` - Added Billdesk to ConnectorEnum
- `backend/domain_types/src/types.rs` - Added Billdesk to Connectors struct
- `backend/grpc-api-types/proto/payment.proto` - Added Billdesk to protobuf Connector enum

### Technical Details
- Migrated from Hyperswitch/Euler Haskell implementation patterns
- Uses UCS v2 macro framework for trait implementations (create_all_prerequisites!, macro_connector_implementation!)
- Implements proper error handling and status mapping
- Full type safety with guard rails (Secret<String> for sensitive data, MinorUnit for amounts)
- Authentication pattern: Merchant ID + Checksum Key (SignatureKey auth type)
- UPI payment flow support with proper request/response transformation
- Stub implementations for unsupported flows (Void, Capture, Refund, etc.)

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Basic connector structure with UCS v2 macros
- ✅ Authentication handling (SignatureKey pattern)
- ✅ UPI payment method support (UpiCollect)
- ✅ Request/response transformers (simplified for compilation)
- ✅ Connector registration in type system
- ✅ Protobuf enum integration
- ⚠️ Some trait implementations need refinement for full compilation
- ⚠️ Complex transformer implementations simplified for initial setup

### Known Issues
- Some SourceVerification trait bounds need resolution
- Complex request/response transformations simplified for initial compilation
- Full business logic from Haskell implementation needs to be integrated
- PSync and other flows need complete implementation

### Next Steps
1. Resolve remaining compilation errors with trait implementations
2. Implement complete request/response transformations based on Haskell business logic
3. Add comprehensive error handling and status mapping
4. Implement PSync flow for payment status synchronization
5. Add proper webhook handling
6. Add comprehensive test coverage
