# Forte Connector Implementation Changelog

## Implementation Progress

### 2025-09-04 - Initial Setup
- **Started**: Forte connector implementation following connectorImplementationGuide.md
- **Read**: connectorErrorFixGuide.md and ai_generate_test.md for reference
- **Target Flows**: Authorize, Capture, Void, PSync, Refund, RSync (skipping other flows as instructed)

### Completed Steps (Steps 1-8)
- âœ… Step 1: Added Forte to ConnectorEnum in backend/domain_types/src/connector_types.rs
- âœ… Step 2: Added Match Arm in ForeignTryFrom for Forte
- âœ… Step 3: Added forte to Connectors struct in backend/domain_types/src/types.rs
- âœ… Step 4: Added Forte in use crate::connectors in backend/connector-integration/src/types.rs
- âœ… Step 5: Added Forte match arm in convert_connector function
- âœ… Step 6: Added forte module in backend/connector-integration/src/connectors.rs
- âœ… Step 7: Added forte.base_url to config/development.toml
- âœ… Step 8: Exported CONNECTOR_NAME=forte and ran fetch scripts successfully

### In Progress - Steps 9-30: Connector File Structure
- âœ… Step 9: Removed all use statements from forte.rs
- âœ… Step 10: Added new import structure with required dependencies
- âœ… Step 11: Removed existing Forte struct and impl
- âœ… Step 12: Removed old impl api:: lines
- âœ… Step 13: Added new trait implementations with generic type parameters
- âœ… Step 14: Added macros::create_all_prerequisites! block
- âœ… Step 15: Added stub implementations for unsupported flows
- âœ… Step 16-20: Added headers module and build_headers function
- âœ… Step 26-30: Started implementing Authorize flow with macro_connector_implementation
- ðŸ”„ Currently working on: Adding remaining flows (PSync, Refund, RSync, Capture, Void)

### Next Steps
- Complete PSync flow implementation
- Add Refund and RSync flows
- Add Capture and Void flows
- Continue with transformers.rs modifications (Steps 61-119)

## Implementation Notes
- Following step-by-step guide exactly as written
- Only implementing specified flows: Authorize, Capture, Void, PSync, Refund, RSync
- Will use connectorErrorFixGuide.md for error resolution at step 122
- Will use ai_generate_test.md for test generation at step 123
