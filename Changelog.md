## 2025-01-02 - Testing and Error Resolution Phase

### Test Environment Setup
- **09:00** - Configured test environment variables for Forte sandbox
  - Set TEST_FORTE_API_KEY for API authentication
  - Set TEST_FORTE_KEY1 and TEST_FORTE_KEY2 for organization and location IDs
  - Set TEST_FORTE_API_SECRET for API secret key

### Initial Test Execution
- **09:15** - Attempted first test run: `cargo test --test forte_payment_flows_test`
- **Result**: Compilation failed with 55 compilation errors
- **Analysis**: Multiple issues identified across imports, type mismatches, and macro compatibility

  - Removed non-existent imports: `HyperswitchConnectorCategory`, `ConnectorIntegrationStatus`
  - Added missing imports: `error_stack::ResultExt`, `SupportedPaymentMethodsExt`
  - Changed `Format` to `FormData` in macro calls (later corrected to `Json`)

### Error Resolution Phase 2: Field and Method Fixes
- **10:00** - Addressed field access and method call issues
  - Fixed billing address access: `item.get_billing_address()` → `item.resource_common_data.get_billing_address()`
  - Fixed billing name access: `item.get_optional_billing_full_name()` → `item.resource_common_data.get_optional_billing_full_name()`
  - Attempted card number conversion fixes
  - Fixed amount conversion attempts

### Error Resolution Phase 3: Response Structure Fixes

  - Removed `charges` field from PaymentsResponseData::TransactionResponse
  - Changed `..item.data` to `..item.router_data` in response transformations
  - Added `status_code` field to response structures

### Error Resolution Phase 4: Metadata and Default Traits
- **11:00** - Fixed metadata handling and trait implementations
  - Added `#[derive(Default)]` to `ForteMeta` struct
  - Fixed `connector_meta` → `connector_metadata` field access
  - Handled PaymentVoidData missing connector_metadata field

### Error Resolution Phase 5: Request Content Type Correction
- **11:30** - Corrected macro request content types
  - Changed `FormData` to `Json` for all request types
  - Removed unsupported `connector_metadata` field from ErrorResponse
  - Added missing `connector_type` field to ConnectorInfo

### Error Resolution Phase 6: Advanced Type System Issues

  - Attempted card issuer detection method fixes
  - Tried amount conversion method corrections
  - Added missing pattern for ResponseId enum

### Test Execution Results

#### First Test Run (09:15)
- **Errors**: 55 compilation errors
- **Main Issues**: Missing imports, wrong field access patterns, macro incompatibility

#### Second Test Run (10:45)
- **Errors**: 32 compilation errors  
- **Progress**: Reduced errors by ~42%
- **Remaining Issues**: Type mismatches, macro system incompatibility

#### Third Test Run (12:15)
- **Errors**: 21 compilation errors
- **Progress**: Reduced errors by ~62% from initial
- **Remaining Issues**: Fundamental API compatibility problems

### Current Status Summary

#### ✅ Successfully Resolved
1. **Import Issues**: Fixed missing and incorrect imports
2. **Field Access**: Corrected RouterDataV2 field access patterns
3. **Response Structure**: Fixed response transformation field mappings
4. **Pattern Matching**: Added missing ResponseId patterns
5. **Trait Implementations**: Added required Default trait
6. **Request Types**: Corrected macro request content types

#### ❌ Unresolved Issues
1. **Macro System Compatibility**: TryFrom trait implementations don't match macro expectations
2. **Card Issuer Detection**: `CardIssuer::get_card_issuer` method doesn't exist
3. **Amount Conversion**: `FloatMajorUnit::from_minor_unit_with_exponent` method missing
4. **Generic Type Constraints**: RawCardNumber<T> missing required trait bounds
5. **Connector Type Enum**: Correct enum name for connector categorization unknown

### Key Findings

#### Architecture Insights
- The connector macro system has specific expectations for trait implementations
- Current implementation patterns don't align with framework requirements
- Generic type system requires careful constraint management
- API methods used may be from different version or documentation

#### Testing Challenges
- Cannot execute functional tests until compilation issues resolved
- Test environment setup completed successfully
- Sandbox credentials properly configured
- Integration test framework ready for execution

### Next Steps Required

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Study Existing Connectors**: Analyze working connector implementations for correct patterns
2. **API Documentation Review**: Verify current API methods and types
3. **Macro System Analysis**: Understand expected trait implementation patterns
4. **Type System Fixes**: Resolve generic type constraint issues

#### Medium-term Goals
1. **Compilation Success**: Achieve clean compilation
2. **Unit Testing**: Execute and validate unit tests
3. **Integration Testing**: Run full payment flow tests
4. **Error Handling**: Validate error scenarios

#### Long-term Objectives
1. **Production Readiness**: Complete security and performance validation
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive API and usage documentation
3. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and metrics
4. **Maintenance**: Establish update and support procedures

### Lessons Learned

- API compatibility must be verified before implementation
- Generic type systems require careful constraint planning
- Macro systems need precise trait implementation patterns

#### Process Improvements
- Incremental development with frequent compilation checks
- Early validation of API method existence
- Study of existing implementations before new development
- Comprehensive error tracking and resolution documentation

### Documentation Updates
- **Summary.md**: Created comprehensive implementation summary
- **Errors.md**: Documented all errors with solutions and status
