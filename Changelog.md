# Forte Connector Implementation Changelog

## Implementation Progress

### 2025-09-04 - Initial Setup
- **Started**: Forte connector implementation following connectorImplementationGuide.md
- **Read**: connectorErrorFixGuide.md and ai_generate_test.md for reference
- **Target Flows**: Authorize, Capture, Void, PSync, Refund, RSync (skipping other flows as instructed)

### Completed Steps (Steps 1-8)
- âœ… Step 1: Added Forte to ConnectorEnum in backend/domain_types/src/connector_types.rs
- âœ… Step 2: Added Match Arm in ForeignTryFrom for Forte
- âœ… Step 3: Added forte to Connectors struct in backend/domain_types/src/types.rs
- âœ… Step 4: Added Forte in use crate::connectors in backend/connector-integration/src/types.rs
- âœ… Step 5: Added Forte match arm in convert_connector function
- âœ… Step 6: Added forte module in backend/connector-integration/src/connectors.rs
- âœ… Step 7: Added forte.base_url to config/development.toml
- âœ… Step 8: Exported CONNECTOR_NAME=forte and ran fetch scripts successfully

### In Progress - Steps 9-30: Connector File Structure
- âœ… Step 9: Removed all use statements from forte.rs
- âœ… Step 10: Added new import structure with required dependencies
- âœ… Step 11: Removed existing Forte struct and impl
- âœ… Step 12: Removed old impl api:: lines
- âœ… Step 13: Added new trait implementations with generic type parameters
- âœ… Step 14: Added macros::create_all_prerequisites! block
- âœ… Step 15: Added stub implementations for unsupported flows
- âœ… Step 16-20: Added headers module and build_headers function
- âœ… Step 26-30: Started implementing Authorize flow with macro_connector_implementation
- ðŸ”„ Currently working on: Adding remaining flows (PSync, Refund, RSync, Capture, Void)

### Next Steps
- Complete PSync flow implementation
- Add Refund and RSync flows
- Add Capture and Void flows
- Continue with transformers.rs modifications (Steps 61-119)

## Files to be Modified

2. backend/domain_types/src/types.rs
3. backend/connector-integration/src/types.rs
4. backend/connector-integration/src/connectors.rs
5. config/development.toml
6. backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/forte.rs (to be created)
7. backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/forte/transformers.rs (to be created)

## [2025-01-04] - Steps 49-60: Capture and Void Flows Implementation
- Added Capture flow macro_connector_implementation with get_headers and get_url functions
- Added Void flow macro_connector_implementation with get_headers and get_url functions
- Both flows now properly handle connector transaction IDs and authentication
- Updated todo status: Steps 49-60 completed

## [2025-01-04] - Steps 61-119: Transformers.rs Modifications Started
- Added new import structure to transformers.rs file
- Added generic type parameters to FortePaymentsRequest struct
- Removed duplicate ForteRouterData struct definition
- Updated use statements for V2 architecture compatibility

## [2025-01-04] - Steps 49-60: Capture and Void Flows Implementation
- Added Capture flow macro_connector_implementation with get_headers and get_url functions
- Added Void flow macro_connector_implementation with get_headers and get_url functions
- Both flows now properly handle connector transaction IDs and authentication
- Updated todo status: Steps 49-60 completed

## [2025-01-04] - Steps 61-119: Transformers.rs Modifications Started
- Removed old use statements and added new V2 architecture imports
- Updated FortePaymentsRequest struct with generic type parameters
- Added proper PaymentMethodDataTypes constraints
- Removed duplicate ForteRouterData struct
- Currently working on: Updating remaining structs and TryFrom implementations

## [2025-09-04] - Testing Phase

### Test Environment Setup
- Set up test environment variables for Forte API credentials
- Created forte_payment_flows_test.rs test file based on elavon test structure
- Test file includes: payment authorization (auto/manual capture), payment sync, refund, refund sync, and health check tests

### Test Execution Results
- **Status**: FAILED - Compilation errors in forte connector implementation
- **Test Command**: `cargo test --test forte_payment_flows_test`
- **Result**: 29 compilation errors preventing test execution

### Major Issues Identified
1. **Headers Module**: Missing headers module definition causing unresolved module errors
2. **Import Issues**: Missing Maskable import from hyperswitch_masking
3. **Trait Implementation Conflicts**: Duplicate ConnectorIntegrationV2 implementations
4. **Method Signature Mismatches**: get_headers and get_url methods have incorrect parameter types
5. **Field Access Errors**: Incorrect field access patterns (req.auth_type, req.request, req.connectors)
6. **Type Conversion Issues**: FloatMajorUnit conversion errors in transformers
7. **Missing Fields**: status_code field missing in RefundsResponseData
8. **Private Function Access**: utils::to_currency_base_unit is not accessible

### Attempted Fixes
- Added headers module with CONTENT_TYPE constant
- Fixed Maskable import in forte.rs
- Removed conflicting trait implementations
- Updated method signatures to match trait requirements
- Fixed field access patterns
- Updated transformers.rs with proper type conversions

### Current Status
- Implementation requires significant architectural fixes
- Multiple compilation errors still present
- Need to align with existing connector patterns and V2 architecture
- Test execution blocked until compilation issues resolved

## Implementation Notes
- Following step-by-step guide exactly as written
- Only implementing specified flows: Authorize, Capture, Void, PSync, Refund, RSync
- Will use connectorErrorFixGuide.md for error resolution at step 122
- Will use ai_generate_test.md for test generation at step 123
- **Testing revealed significant implementation gaps requiring further development**
