# Component Progress: Domain Types (`backend/domain_types`)

## 1. Component-Specific Implementation Status

*   **Overall Status:** Core files (`types.rs`, `connector_flow.rs`, `connector_types.rs`, `errors.rs`, `lib.rs`, `utils.rs`) have been reviewed at a high level to understand their purpose and the main data structures/traits they define.
*   **Current Focus:** Documenting the established patterns and context for this crate.

## 2. Key Files Status

| File / Module           | Status          | Key Responsibilities (Confirmed)                                                                                                | Next Steps (for MB & Code)                                                                                                |
| :---------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`types.rs`**          | **Reviewed**    | Defines core data structs, `ForeignTryFrom` for gRPC types, gRPC response generation helpers, `Connectors` config struct.        | Further review specific data structures as needed when analyzing individual payment flows.                                |
| **`connector_flow.rs`** | **Reviewed**    | Defines marker structs for payment flows (e.g., `Authorize`, `Capture`).                                                        | N/A - Purpose understood.                                                                                                 |
| **`connector_types.rs`**| **Reviewed**    | Defines `ConnectorServiceTrait`, flow-specific traits (e.g., `PaymentAuthorizeV2`), `ConnectorEnum`, `IncomingWebhook` trait.    | Examine how these traits are precisely used by `connector-integration` and specific connectors.                           |
| **`errors.rs`**         | **Reviewed**    | Defines `ApiError`, `ApplicationErrorResponse`.                                                                                 | Analyze error propagation paths in more detail during flow analysis.                                                      |
| **`lib.rs`**            | **Reviewed**    | Crate root, re-exports.                                                                                                         | N/A - Purpose understood.                                                                                                 |
| **`utils.rs`**          | **Reviewed**    | Contains `ForeignTryFrom` and `ForeignFrom` trait definitions.                                                                  | N/A - Purpose understood.                                                                                                 |

## 3. Current Work Focus (Within This Component)

*   **MB Creation & Population:** Creating and populating `localContext.md`, `componentPatterns.md`, and this `componentProgress.md` file based on the initial analysis of the crate's structure and key files.

## 4. Known Issues and Challenges (Component Level)

*   None identified from a Memory Bank perspective.
*   Potential challenge: Maintaining consistency and clarity in the numerous data structures and traits as the system evolves and supports more features or connectors.

## 5. Planned Improvements / Next Steps (Development)

*   *(To be filled in if specific refactoring or improvements are identified in this crate during deeper analysis of other components.)*
*   **Short-term (MB):**
    1.  Ensure `localContext.md` and `componentPatterns.md` accurately reflect the findings from the file reviews.
    2.  Cross-reference with `hyperswitch_interfaces` and `hyperswitch_domain_models` to better understand the origin and purpose of some of the re-used or foundational types/traits.

## 6. Recent Changes (Within This Component)

*   Created initial Local Memory Bank files for the `domain_types` component:
    *   `localContext.md`
    *   `componentPatterns.md`
    *   `componentProgress.md` (this file)
*   Reviewed key source files (`types.rs`, `connector_flow.rs`, `connector_types.rs`, `errors.rs`, `lib.rs`, `utils.rs`).

*(This file will track the detailed progress of the domain_types component.)*
