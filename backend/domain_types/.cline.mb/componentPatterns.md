# Component Patterns: Domain Types (`backend/domain_types`)

## 1. Component-Specific Design Patterns

*   **Data-Centric Design:** This crate primarily focuses on defining data structures (structs, enums) and traits. It has minimal executable logic beyond type conversions and utility functions.
*   **Trait-Based Abstraction:**
    *   Defines `ConnectorServiceTrait` which aggregates various flow-specific traits (e.g., `PaymentAuthorizeV2`, `RefundV2`).
    *   These flow-specific traits are often type aliases for the generic `ConnectorIntegrationV2<Flow, RequestData, ResponseData>` trait from `hyperswitch_interfaces`. This pattern allows for strong typing and specialization of connector behavior for each payment flow.
*   **Marker Types for Flows:** Empty structs in `connector_flow.rs` (e.g., `Authorize`, `Capture`, `PSync`) serve as marker types. They are used as generic parameters in `ConnectorIntegrationV2` and `RouterDataV2` to provide compile-time context about the specific payment operation being performed.
*   **Generic Data Carrier (`RouterDataV2`):** The `RouterDataV2<Flow, ResourceCommonData, Request, Response>` struct (from `hyperswitch_domain_models`) is a key pattern. It acts as a generic container to pass all relevant data for a specific flow through various processing stages, including to the `connector-integration` layer and `external-services`.
*   **Custom Conversion Trait (`ForeignTryFrom`):** This trait is extensively used in `types.rs` to provide a standardized way of converting between gRPC types (from `grpc-api-types`) and the internal domain models. This helps in decoupling layers and managing conversion errors.
*   **Enum for Connectors (`ConnectorEnum`):** `connector_types.rs` defines an enum for supported connectors, which can be used for dispatching or configuration.

## 2. Internal Architecture

The crate is primarily organized into modules defining different aspects of the domain:

*   **`types.rs`:**
    *   Defines core data structures for payment requests and responses (e.g., `PaymentsAuthorizeData`, `PaymentsResponseData`, `RefundsData`).
    *   Contains numerous `ForeignTryFrom` implementations for converting gRPC request/response types to/from internal domain types.
    *   Includes helper functions to generate gRPC responses from `RouterDataV2` (e.g., `generate_payment_authorize_response`).
    *   Defines `Connectors` struct for holding connector-specific configurations like base URLs.
*   **`connector_flow.rs`:**
    *   Contains empty marker structs (e.g., `Authorize`, `Capture`, `Refund`, `PSync`, `RSync`, `Void`, `SetupMandate`, `Accept`) representing different payment/connector operations.
*   **`connector_types.rs`:**
    *   Defines the main `ConnectorServiceTrait` and its constituent flow-specific traits (e.g., `PaymentAuthorizeV2`, `PaymentSyncV2`, `RefundV2`). These traits are crucial for the Adapter pattern implemented by individual connectors.
    *   Defines `ConnectorEnum` for identifying different payment connectors.
    *   Defines `PaymentFlowData`, `RefundFlowData`, `DisputeFlowData` which are used as `ResourceCommonData` in `RouterDataV2`.
    *   Defines `IncomingWebhook` trait.
*   **`errors.rs`:**
    *   Defines `ApiError` and `ApplicationErrorResponse` for standardized error reporting within the domain.
*   **`lib.rs`:**
    *   The crate root, re-exporting necessary items from its modules.
*   **`utils.rs`:**
    *   Likely contains utility functions or helper traits, including the definition of `ForeignTryFrom` and `ForeignFrom`.

## 3. Key Algorithms and Approaches

*   **Type Safety through Generics and Traits:** The use of generic parameters (like `F`, `ResourceCommonData`, `Req`, `Resp` in `RouterDataV2` and `ConnectorIntegrationV2`) along with marker types for flows ensures strong type safety and allows the compiler to verify correct data usage for different operations.
*   **Decoupling via Transformation:** The `ForeignTryFrom` implementations in `types.rs` decouple the gRPC API layer from the internal domain models and the models used by `hyperswitch_interfaces`.
*   **Centralized Trait Definitions:** Defining the core connector interaction traits within this crate provides a single point of reference for how connectors should behave.

## 4. Data Flows Within the Component

*   This component primarily defines types, so data doesn't "flow" through it in a processing sense.
*   However, its types are instantiated and transformed:
    *   `grpc-server` instantiates domain request types from gRPC requests.
    *   `connector-integration` consumes these domain request types and produces domain response types.
    *   `grpc-server` consumes domain response types to generate gRPC responses.

## 5. State Management Strategies

*   This crate is stateless. It defines types and traits but does not manage or hold runtime state.

*(This is an initial draft based on recent analysis. It will be refined as the component's code is analyzed in more detail.)*
