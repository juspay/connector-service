# Component Progress: External Services (`backend/external-services`)

## 1. Component-Specific Implementation Status

*   **Overall Status:** The main file `service.rs` has been reviewed to understand its core functionality, particularly the `execute_connector_processing_step` function and HTTP client management.
*   **Current Focus:** Documenting the established patterns and context for this crate.

## 2. Key Files Status

| File / Module    | Status       | Key Responsibilities (Confirmed)                                                                                                | Next Steps (for MB & Code)                                                                                                |
| :--------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`service.rs`** | **Reviewed** | Contains `execute_connector_processing_step`, `call_connector_api`, HTTP client creation/management, logging utilities.         | Further review specific aspects like proxy handling details or error nuances if issues arise during deeper analysis of connector flows. |
| **`lib.rs`**     | **Reviewed** | Crate root, re-exports items from `service.rs`.                                                                                 | N/A - Purpose understood.                                                                                                 |

## 3. Current Work Focus (Within This Component)

*   **MB Creation & Population:** Creating and populating `localContext.md`, `componentPatterns.md`, and this `componentProgress.md` file based on the analysis of `service.rs`.

## 4. Known Issues and Challenges (Component Level)

*   None identified from a Memory Bank perspective.
*   Potential challenge: Ensuring the HTTP client configurations (timeouts, pool sizes, proxy settings) are optimal for performance and reliability across various network conditions and connector behaviors.
*   The client certificate handling logic is currently commented out in `create_client`, which might be relevant if mTLS is required for any connectors.

## 5. Planned Improvements / Next Steps (Development)

*   *(To be filled in if specific refactoring or improvements are identified in this crate.)*
*   **Short-term (MB):**
    1.  Ensure `localContext.md` and `componentPatterns.md` accurately reflect the findings from the `service.rs` review.

## 6. Recent Changes (Within This Component)

*   Created initial Local Memory Bank files for the `external-services` component:
    *   `localContext.md`
    *   `componentPatterns.md`
    *   `componentProgress.md` (this file)
*   Reviewed key source file `service.rs`.

*(This file will track the detailed progress of the external-services component.)*
