# Component Progress: Adyen Connector

## 1. Component-Specific Implementation Status

*   **Overall Status:** Initial setup. Local Memory Bank files created. Code analysis pending.
*   **Current Focus:** Understanding the specific files within `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/` (i.e., `transformers.rs`, `test.rs` and the main `adyen.rs` or `mod.rs`) and how they implement Adyen-specific logic.

## 2. Key Files Status (within `adyen/`)

| File / Module        | Status          | Key Responsibilities (Inferred)                                     | Next Steps (for MB & Code)                                                                                                |
| :------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`adyen.rs` (or `mod.rs`)** | Unknown    | Main Adyen connector logic, trait implementation, orchestration.    | Review to understand how it uses transformers and client logic.                                                           |
| **`transformers.rs`**| Unknown         | Data mapping between `domain_types` and Adyen API formats.          | Detailed analysis of request/response structs and mapping functions. This is critical.                                    |
| **`client.rs` (if exists)** | Unknown    | HTTP client logic for Adyen API calls.                              | Review API call construction, authentication, error handling.                                                             |
| **`webhooks.rs` (if exists)** | Unknown  | Adyen webhook validation and processing.                            | Review event handling and signature validation.                                                                           |
| **`types.rs` (if exists)** | Unknown     | Adyen-specific internal types.                                      | Review any custom types defined for Adyen.                                                                                |
| **`test.rs`**        | Unknown         | Unit tests for Adyen connector logic.                               | Analyze test cases to understand expected behavior, especially for transformers and edge cases.                           |

## 3. Current Work Focus (Within This Adyen Component)

*   **MB Population:** Detailing `localContext.md` and `componentPatterns.md` based on inferred structure and common Adyen integration patterns.
*   **Code Skimming:** A high-level pass over the files in the `adyen/` directory.

## 4. Known Issues and Challenges (Adyen-Specific)

*   None identified yet from a Memory Bank perspective.
*   **Complexity of Adyen API:** Adyen's API is extensive; supporting a wide range of features can be complex.
*   **Payment Method Variety:** Adyen supports many global and local payment methods, each potentially having unique integration details.
*   **Action Handling:** Managing Adyen's `action` objects (for 3DS, redirects, etc.) in a generic way can be challenging.
*   **API Version Updates:** Keeping up with Adyen API changes.

## 5. Planned Improvements / Next Steps (Development)

*   *(To be filled in after code review and understanding current capabilities)*
*   **Short-term (MB):**
    1.  Thoroughly review `transformers.rs` as it's central to the connector's function. Document key transformations.
    2.  Analyze how `adyen.rs` (or `mod.rs`) implements the common connector trait.
    3.  Examine `test.rs` to understand what aspects are being tested and how.
    4.  Update `localContext.md` and `componentPatterns.md` with concrete findings from the code.

## 6. Recent Changes (Within This Adyen Component)

*   Created initial Local Memory Bank files for the Adyen connector:
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/.cline.mb/localContext.md`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/.cline.mb/componentPatterns.md`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/.cline.mb/componentProgress.md` (this file)

*(This file will track the detailed progress of the Adyen connector component.)*
