# Local Context: Adyen Connector

## 1. Component Purpose and Responsibilities

This component (`backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/`) is specifically responsible for all interactions with the Adyen payment gateway. Its duties include:

*   Implementing the standardized connector interface (defined in the parent `connector-integration` component or `domain_types`) for Adyen-specific operations.
*   Transforming standardized payment requests from the core system into Adyen API request formats.
*   Handling Adyen-specific API calls for various payment actions (e.g., authorizations, captures, refunds, payment method list, webhook processing).
*   Interpreting Adyen API responses (including errors) and transforming them back into the system's standardized format.
*   Managing Adyen-specific authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys).
*   Processing Adyen webhooks and translating them into standardized internal events.

## 2. Relationship to Overall System

*   **Parent Context:** This Local Memory Bank inherits from and builds upon:
    1.  The Local Memory Bank for the `connector-integration` component (`backend/connector-integration/.cline.mb/`).
    2.  The Root Memory Bank (`/.cline.mb/`).
    Refer to these parent contexts for broader system architecture, shared patterns, and overall project goals.
*   **Used By:** The `connector-integration` component's router/selector logic will delegate requests to this Adyen connector when Adyen is the target payment gateway.
*   **Uses:**
    *   Standardized data models from `domain_types`.
    *   Common traits or utilities from the parent `connector-integration` component.
    *   Makes HTTP calls to the Adyen API endpoints.

## 3. Integration Points

*   **Internal:**
    *   Implements a trait (e.g., `PaymentConnector`) defined by the `connector-integration` component.
    *   Consumes and produces data types from `domain_types`.
*   **External:**
    *   Communicates directly with Adyen's various API endpoints (e.g., `/payments`, `/refunds`, `/paymentMethods`).
    *   Receives webhooks from Adyen.

## 4. Local Design Decisions (Initial Thoughts)

*   **API Versioning:** Adyen API versions will need to be managed.
*   **Specific Endpoints:** Logic will be structured around Adyen's specific API capabilities (e.g., separate handling for different payment flows like Drop-in, Components).
*   **Webhook Handling:** A dedicated module or functions for validating and processing different Adyen webhook event types.
*   `transformers.rs`: Will be crucial for mapping between generic payment objects and Adyen's detailed request/response structures.
*   `test.rs`: Will contain unit tests specific to Adyen integration logic.

## 5. Component-Specific Constraints

*   Adherence to Adyen's API specifications, rate limits, and security requirements.
*   Handling Adyen's specific error codes and messages.
*   Supporting various Adyen payment methods and flows as required by the project.

*(This is an initial draft. It will be refined as the Adyen connector's code is analyzed in detail.)*
