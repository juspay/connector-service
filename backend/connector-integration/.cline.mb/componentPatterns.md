# Component Patterns: Connector Integration

## 1. Component-Specific Design Patterns

*   **Adapter Pattern:** This is the core pattern for this component. Each payment gateway (e.g., Adyen, Razorpay) will have its own adapter (`adyen.rs`, `razorpay.rs`). These adapters will implement a common trait (e.g., `PaymentConnector` or similar) defined within this crate or in `domain_types`. This trait will standardize operations like `authorize`, `capture`, `refund`, `void`, `sync_payment_status`, etc.
    *   **Input:** Standardized request objects from `domain_types`.
    *   **Output:** Standardized response objects from `domain_types`.
    *   **Internal:** Each adapter handles the specific API calls, data transformations, and error handling for its respective gateway.

*   **Strategy Pattern (Implicit):** The `grpc-server` or a core payment service will likely use a strategy to select the appropriate connector adapter at runtime based on request parameters (e.g., `connector_id`, `payment_method_type`) or merchant configuration. This component provides the concrete strategies (the adapters).

*   **Factory Pattern (Potential):** A factory might be used to instantiate connector adapters. This factory could take a connector type and configuration, then return an instance of the appropriate adapter. This would centralize the creation logic.

*   **Error Handling Abstraction:** A common error type or enum should be defined within this component (or in `domain_types`) to represent various connector-related errors (e.g., API errors, authentication failures, network issues). Adapters will map gateway-specific errors to these common error types.

```

*   **Connector Trait:** A central Rust trait (e.g., `trait PaymentProcessor`) will define the common interface for all payment operations.
*   **Connector Modules:** Each connector (e.g., `adyen`, `razorpay`) will be a separate Rust module (`src/connectors/adyen.rs`, `src/connectors/razorpay/mod.rs`).
    *   `transformers.rs`: Handles mapping between the system's standard domain types and the specific request/response formats of the external gateway.
    *   `client.rs` (or similar): Handles the actual HTTP API calls to the external gateway, including authentication.
    *   `errors.rs`: Defines connector-specific error types and conversions to the common error type.
*   **Shared Utilities:** `src/utils.rs` might contain common helper functions, e.g., for HTTP requests, data masking, etc.
*   **Macros:** `src/connectors/macros.rs` likely helps reduce boilerplate in defining adapters or common functionalities.

## 3. Key Algorithms and Approaches

*   **Data Transformation:** Robust and type-safe mapping between internal models and external API schemas. `serde` will be heavily used.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** All I/O-bound operations (API calls to gateways) must be asynchronous (`async/await`), likely using `tokio` and an HTTP client like `reqwest`.
*   **Configuration Management:** Secure loading and access to connector API keys and other settings. This might involve integration with a configuration service or encrypted storage, though initially, it might come from `config/development.toml`.
*   **Retry Mechanisms & Idempotency:** For critical operations, implementing retry logic with backoff for transient network errors. Ensuring idempotency for payment operations where appropriate (e.g., using idempotency keys if supported by gateways).

## 4. Data Flows Within the Component

1.  **Incoming Request:** The component receives a standardized payment operation request (e.g., `ProcessPaymentData`) and target connector information.
2.  **Transformation:** The specific connector's `transformers.rs` module maps this to the gateway's API request format.
3.  **API Call:** The connector's client module makes the HTTP call to the gateway, handling authentication.
4.  **Response Handling:** The gateway's response is received.
5.  **Transformation:** The `transformers.rs` module maps the gateway's response (success or error) back to a standardized internal format.
6.  **Return:** The standardized response is returned to the calling service.

## 5. State Management Strategies

*   This component is primarily stateless regarding long-term payment state, which should reside in a persistent datastore managed by a higher-level service.
*   It may temporarily hold state related to ongoing API calls (e.g., for retries or timeouts).
*   Connector configurations (keys, endpoints) are state loaded at startup.
