# Local Context: Connector Integration Component

## 1. Component Purpose and Responsibilities

This component is responsible for managing all integrations with third-party payment gateways (connectors). Its primary duties include:

*   Providing a standardized interface for the core system to interact with various payment connectors.
*   Adapting requests from the core system's format to the specific format required by each payment gateway.
*   Transforming responses from payment gateways back into a standardized format for the core system.
*   Handling connector-specific authentication, API calls, and error management.
*   Facilitating the addition of new payment connectors with minimal changes to the core system.

## 2. Relationship to Overall System

*   **Parent Context:** This Local Memory Bank inherits from and builds upon the Root Memory Bank located at the project root (`/.cline.mb/`). Refer to the Root Memory Bank for overall project goals, system architecture, and technology stack.
*   **Consumed By:** The `grpc-server` component (and potentially other core services) will utilize this `connector-integration` component to process payment operations.
*   **Uses:** This component relies on `domain_types` for standardized data models (e.g., payment requests, responses). It makes external API calls to various payment gateways.

## 3. Integration Points

*   **Internal:**
    *   Exposes functions/traits that the `grpc-server` or a core payment service calls to initiate payment actions (e.g., `process_payment`, `refund_payment`).
    *   Consumes data types defined in `domain_types`.
*   **External:**
    *   Connects to the APIs of various payment providers (e.g., Adyen, Razorpay).

## 4. Local Design Decisions (Initial Thoughts)

*   Each connector (Adyen, Razorpay, etc.) will be implemented as a separate module within this component.
*   A common trait or interface will likely be defined for all connectors to adhere to, ensuring consistency (Adapter Pattern).
*   Configuration for each connector (API keys, endpoints) will be managed securely and loaded at runtime.

## 5. Component-Specific Constraints

*   Must be able to handle varying API behaviors and response times from external gateways.
*   Security in handling connector credentials and sensitive data is paramount.
*   Error handling needs to be robust to differentiate between internal errors and errors from external gateways.

*(This is an initial draft. It will be refined as the component's code is analyzed in detail.)*
