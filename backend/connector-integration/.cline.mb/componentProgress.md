# Component Progress: Connector Integration

## 1. Component-Specific Implementation Status

*   **Overall Status:** Initial setup. Local Memory Bank files created. Code analysis pending.
*   **Current Focus:** Understanding the existing structure of the `connector-integration` crate, particularly how `adyen` and `razorpay` connectors are implemented and how they might share common logic or traits.

## 2. Connectors Status

| Connector | Status          | Key Files                                      | Notes                                                                 | Next Steps (for MB & Code)                                                                                                |
| :-------- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Adyen** | Unknown         | `src/connectors/adyen.rs`, `src/connectors/adyen/` | Appears to be one of the primary implemented connectors.              | Review `adyen.rs` and files in `adyen/` (especially `transformers.rs`). Document its specific implementation patterns. |
| **Razorpay**| Unknown         | `src/connectors/razorpay.rs`, `src/connectors/razorpay/` | Appears to be another primary implemented connector.            | Review `razorpay.rs` and files in `razorpay/` (especially `transformers.rs`). Document its specific implementation patterns. |
| **Common Logic** | Unknown    | `src/connectors.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/connectors/macros.rs` | Files that might define shared traits, error handling, or utilities. | Analyze these files to understand shared abstractions and helpers.                                                          |

## 3. Current Work Focus (Within This Component)

*   **MB Population:** Detailing the `localContext.md` and `componentPatterns.md` based on initial file structure analysis.
*   **Code Skimming:** A high-level pass over `src/lib.rs`, `src/connectors.rs`, and the module files for Adyen and Razorpay to get a feel for the structure.

## 4. Known Issues and Challenges (Component Level)

*   None identified yet from a Memory Bank perspective.
*   Potential challenge: Ensuring consistent error handling and data transformation logic across an increasing number of diverse connectors.
*   Potential challenge: Managing API version changes from external payment gateways.

## 5. Planned Improvements / Next Steps (Development)

*   *(To be filled in after code review and understanding current capabilities)*
*   **Short-term (MB):**
    1.  Review `Cargo.toml` for this crate to understand its specific dependencies.
    2.  Analyze `src/lib.rs` to understand how connectors are registered or exposed.
    3.  Dive deep into `adyen.rs` and `razorpay.rs` along with their respective sub-modules (`transformers.rs`, `test.rs`).
    4.  Update `localContext.md` and `componentPatterns.md` with findings.
*   **Long-term (MB):**
    *   Consider if individual connectors like Adyen or Razorpay are complex enough to warrant their own nested Local Memory Banks (e.g., `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/.cline.mb/`). This will depend on the amount of specific logic and context each contains.

## 6. Recent Changes (Within This Component)

*   Created initial Local Memory Bank files:
    *   `backend/connector-integration/.cline.mb/localContext.md`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/.cline.mb/componentPatterns.md`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/.cline.mb/componentProgress.md` (this file)

*(This file will track the detailed progress of the connector-integration component.)*
