# Local Context: gRPC Server Component

## 1. Component Purpose and Responsibilities

This component (`backend/grpc-server/`) is the primary entry point for all external client interactions with the connector service. Its main responsibilities are:

*   **Exposing gRPC API:** Implementing the gRPC services defined in `backend/grpc-api-types/proto/` (e.g., `PaymentService`, `HealthCheckService`).
*   **Request Handling:** Receiving incoming gRPC requests, validating them, and deserializing them into internal data structures.
*   **Orchestration:** Coordinating with other backend components (primarily `domain_types` for core logic and `connector-integration` for payment gateway operations) to fulfill client requests.
*   **Response Generation:** Serializing internal responses into gRPC message formats and sending them back to the client.
*   **Authentication & Authorization (Potential):** May handle initial authentication of client requests before passing them to downstream services.
*   **Logging & Metrics:** Implementing comprehensive logging for requests/responses and exposing metrics for monitoring server health and performance.
*   **Configuration Management:** Loading and applying runtime configurations (e.g., server address, port, logging levels, downstream service addresses).

## 2. Relationship to Overall System

*   **Parent Context:** This Local Memory Bank inherits from and builds upon the Root Memory Bank (`/.cline.mb/`).
*   **Entry Point:** Acts as the main public-facing interface of the backend system.
*   **Uses:**
    *   `grpc-api-types`: For gRPC service definitions and message types.
    *   `domain_types`: For internal representation of business objects and core logic processing.
    *   `connector-integration`: To delegate payment-specific operations to the appropriate payment gateway.
    *   `external-services` (potentially): For any other auxiliary services it might need to interact with.
*   **Consumed By:** Client applications, SDKs (`sdk/`), and example applications (`examples/`).

## 3. Integration Points

*   **External:**
    *   Listens on a configured network port for incoming gRPC connections.
    *   Exposes services defined in `.proto` files (e.g., `PaymentService.CreatePayment`, `HealthCheckService.Check`).
*   **Internal:**
    *   Calls functions/methods in `domain_types` to process business logic.
    *   Calls functions/methods in `connector-integration` to execute payment operations via external gateways.
    *   Utilizes logging (`src/logger/`) and metrics (`src/metrics.rs`) subsystems.
    *   Reads configuration via `src/configs.rs`.

## 4. Local Design Decisions (Initial Thoughts)

*   **Service Implementation:** Each gRPC service (e.g., `PaymentsService`, `HealthCheckService`) will have a corresponding implementation structure within `src/server/`.
*   **Application State:** An `AppState` or similar structure (`src/app.rs`) might be used to hold shared resources like database connections (if any), connector clients, configuration, etc., and pass them to gRPC service handlers.
*   **Error Handling:** Standardized error mapping from internal errors (from `domain_types`, `connector-integration`) to gRPC status codes and error messages. `src/error.rs` likely defines this.
*   **Middleware/Interceptors (Potential):** gRPC interceptors might be used for common concerns like logging, metrics, authentication, or request validation.

## 5. Component-Specific Constraints

*   **Performance:** Must handle a high volume of requests with low latency.
*   **Scalability:** Should be designed to scale horizontally.
*   **Reliability:** Must be robust and provide clear error feedback to clients.
*   **Security:** Secure gRPC communication (e.g., TLS) is essential. Input validation is critical.

*(This is an initial draft. It will be refined as the component's code is analyzed in detail.)*
