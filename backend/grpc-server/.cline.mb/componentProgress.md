# Component Progress: gRPC Server

## 1. Component-Specific Implementation Status

*   **Overall Status:** Initial setup. Local Memory Bank files created. Code analysis pending.
*   **Current Focus:** Understanding the high-level structure of the `grpc-server` crate, including its entry point (`main.rs`), application state (`app.rs`), server setup (`server.rs`), and how gRPC services are implemented (`src/server/`).

## 2. Key Sub-Modules Status

| Sub-Module / File        | Status          | Key Responsibilities (Inferred)                                     | Next Steps (for MB & Code)                                                                                                |
| :----------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`main.rs`**            | Unknown         | Application entry point, initializes server, logging, config.       | Review to understand server startup sequence and `AppState` creation.                                                     |
| **`app.rs`**             | Unknown         | Defines `AppState` for shared resources.                            | Analyze `AppState` struct to identify shared dependencies.                                                                |
| **`server.rs`**          | Unknown         | Configures and launches the Tonic gRPC server, adds services.       | Review server setup, interceptor registration (if any).                                                                   |
| **`src/server/payments.rs`** | Unknown     | Implements the `PaymentService` gRPCs.                              | Detailed review of RPC handlers, interaction with `domain_types` and `connector-integration`.                             |
| **`src/server/health_check.rs`** | Unknown | Implements the `HealthCheckService` gRPCs.                          | Review health check logic.                                                                                                |
| **`configs.rs`**         | Unknown         | Loads and provides application configuration.                       | Understand how configuration is loaded and accessed.                                                                      |
| **`logger/`**            | Unknown         | Custom logging setup.                                               | Review logger configuration and formatting.                                                                               |
| **`metrics.rs`**         | Unknown         | Metrics collection and exposure.                                    | Identify what metrics are collected and how they are exposed (e.g., Prometheus endpoint).                                 |
| **`error.rs`**           | Unknown         | Defines error types and gRPC status code mappings.                  | Analyze error hierarchy and conversion logic.                                                                             |

## 3. Current Work Focus (Within This Component)

*   **MB Population:** Detailing `localContext.md` and `componentPatterns.md` based on initial file structure analysis and common Rust/gRPC patterns.
*   **Code Skimming:** A high-level pass over `main.rs`, `app.rs`, `server.rs`, and the service implementation files.

## 4. Known Issues and Challenges (Component Level)

*   None identified yet from a Memory Bank perspective.
*   Potential challenge: Ensuring robust error propagation from downstream services to gRPC status codes.
*   Potential challenge: Managing complexity as the number of gRPC services and RPCs grows.
*   Potential challenge: Efficiently handling shared state (`AppState`) in a highly concurrent environment.

## 5. Planned Improvements / Next Steps (Development)

*   *(To be filled in after code review and understanding current capabilities)*
*   **Short-term (MB):**
    1.  Review `Cargo.toml` for this crate to understand its specific dependencies (e.g., `tonic`, `tokio`, `serde`, `config`, logging/metrics crates).
    2.  Analyze `main.rs` and `server.rs` to understand the server lifecycle and setup.
    3.  Deep dive into `app.rs` to fully understand `AppState`.
    4.  Examine one service implementation (e.g., `payments.rs`) in detail, tracing a request flow.
    5.  Review `error.rs` to understand error handling mechanisms.
    6.  Update `localContext.md` and `componentPatterns.md` with findings.

## 6. Recent Changes (Within This Component)

*   Created initial Local Memory Bank files:
    *   `backend/grpc-server/.cline.mb/localContext.md`
    *   `backend/grpc-server/.cline.mb/componentPatterns.md`
    *   `backend/grpc-server/.cline.mb/componentProgress.md` (this file)

*(This file will track the detailed progress of the grpc-server component.)*
