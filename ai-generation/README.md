# Connector Integration AI

This project focuses on automating the generation, building, and testing of connector code, eliminating manual intervention. 
In this hackathon, our primary goal is to streamline the migration of authorize flows from various connectors to Hyperswitch.

## Problem Statement

To generate, build, and test connector code autonomously, without any manual intervention. This project specifically addresses the migration of authorize flows from any existing connector to Hyperswitch.

## Phases

The broader project encompasses several migration and integration strategies:

1.  **Migration from Hyperswitch (Current Focus)**
2.  Migration from Euler
3.  Third-party reference (e.g., Active Merchant)
4.  Integration from scratch

Currently, we are focused on the first phase: **Migration from Hyperswitch**.

## Approach

Our approach leverages a set of structured documents to guide the AI in the code generation and troubleshooting process:

*   `build_workflow.md`: Contains the step-by-step process for building the connector.
*   `connector_integration_guide.md`: Provides references and examples for the necessary code changes.
*   `error_build.md`: A knowledge base of common build errors and their resolutions.
*   `error_test.md`: A knowledge base for common test errors and their resolutions.

## Tools Used

*   **Cursor**: The AI-powered code editor used for development and interaction.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental 03-25)**: The underlying large language model powering the AI capabilities.

## How to Use

1.  **Install Cursor**: Ensure you have Cursor installed and set up.
2.  Checkout to this branch for the context files https://github.com/juspay/connector-service/tree/ai-connector-integration
3.  **Provide Context Files**: Add the following files as context to the AI assistant within Cursor:
    *   `build_workflow.md`
    *   `connector_integration_guide.md`
    *   The `connector.rs` file from the Hyperswitch documentation/repository for the connector being migrated.
    *   The `transformer.rs` file from the Hyperswitch documentation/repository for the connector being migrated.
    *   For better accuracy, also include the specific files where changes are anticipated, such as:
        *   `types.rs` (of the connector)
        *   `connector.rs` (of the connector)
        *   Relevant `connector_types.rs` (Hyperswitch core types if needed)
4.  **Paste the Prompt**: Use the following prompt structure (replace `{{prompt}}` with your specific instructions):

    ```
    Run the workflow for integrating {{authorize}} flow for connector {{paypal}} with reference from hyperswitch. Follow each steps mentioned in build_workflow.md.
    ```

## Disclaimer

1.  **Accuracy**: The AI-generated code is not always successful on the first attempt. It currently achieves an accuracy of approximately 70% and above. Manual review and potential modifications may be necessary.
2.  **AI-Generated Files**: All primary output files related to the connector integration are generated by the AI.
3.  **Evolving Knowledge Base**: As this system is used more frequently, the `error_build.md` and `error_test.md` (memory bank) will be updated, improving future accuracy and reducing troubleshooting time.
4.  **Experimental Stage**: This is an ongoing project, and the tools and methodologies are subject to refinement.

## Benefits (10x Improvement)

*   **Reduced Integration Time**: Connector integration for a single flow can be reduced from approximately 2 days to 2 hours (1 hour for generation and 1 hour for resolving any issues).
*   **Exploration of New Technologies**: Frees up developer time to explore and adopt new technologies and patterns.

## Next Steps

*   **End-to-End API Testing**: Implement connector API testing for comprehensive end-to-end validation.
*   **MCP for Type Extraction**: Explore using a Meta-programming Code Processor (MCP) to automatically extract and structure types from Hyperswitch.
*   **Support for Other Flows**: Extend the AI's capabilities to support other payment flows beyond authorize (e.g., capture, refund, void).
*   **Optimize Knowledge Base**:
    *   Improve how the knowledge base is searched (e.g., by indexing error types).
    *   Refine how the knowledge base is updated (e.g., by implementing a more granular file structure for errors).
