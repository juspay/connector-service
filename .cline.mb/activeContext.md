# Active Context: Connector Service

## 1. Current Focus

*   **Project Analysis & Memory Bank Enrichment:** Deepening the understanding of the `connector-service` project by analyzing its codebase, documentation, and updating the Memory Bank files accordingly.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   **Completed Initial Analysis Phase:**
    *   Read and reviewed Root Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
    *   Read and reviewed Local Memory Bank files for `grpc-server`, `connector-integration`, `adyen` connector, and `razorpay` connector.
    *   Read project documentation: `README.md` and `docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
    *   Analyzed `Cargo.toml` files for the root workspace and key backend crates (`grpc-server`, `connector-integration`, `domain_types`, `grpc-api-types`) to understand dependencies.
    *   Reviewed directory tree structures for `grpc-server/src`, `connector-integration/src`, and `domain_types/src`.
    *   Traced a Payment Authorization flow by reading key files:
        *   `domain_types/src/{types.rs, connector_flow.rs, connector_types.rs}`
        *   `connector-integration/src/{connectors.rs, lib.rs, connectors/adyen.rs, connectors/adyen/transformers.rs}`
        *   `grpc-server/src/server/payments.rs`
        *   `external-services/src/service.rs`
*   **Updated Root Memory Bank:**
    *   Refined `systemPatterns.md` with more accurate architectural details, design patterns (Adapter, Strategy, DTO, Template Method), component relationships, and a critical implementation path for Payment Authorization.
    *   Updated `techContext.md` with confirmed key dependencies for major backend crates.
    *   Updated `progress.md` to reflect the current analysis status.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Create New Local Memory Banks:**
    *   For `backend/domain_types/.cline.mb/`
    *   For `backend/external-services/.cline.mb/`
2.  **Populate New and Existing Local Memory Banks:** Add detailed findings from the code analysis to the respective Local Memory Bank files.
3.  **Continue Deeper Code Analysis:**
    *   Analyze other critical payment flows (e.g., Refunds, Captures, Voids, Webhooks).
    *   Investigate error handling strategies in more detail.
    *   Review the `checkout` connector.
4.  **Refine Root Memory Bank:** Continue to update Root Memory Bank files as understanding deepens.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The Memory Bank is being iteratively refined with information gathered from documentation and direct code analysis.
*   Prioritizing understanding of core flows and architectural patterns.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Confirmed & Refined)

*   **Layered Architecture:** Confirmed clear separation into API, Domain, Connector Integration, and External Services layers.
*   **Trait-Based Abstraction:** The `ConnectorIntegrationV2` trait is central to the connector model, enabling polymorphism and extensibility.
*   **Generic Flow Execution:** The `execute_connector_processing_step` function in `external-services` provides a template method for handling all connector interactions.
*   **Data Transformation:** Extensive use of `ForeignTryFrom` for converting between gRPC types and internal domain models. Connector-specific `transformers.rs` files are critical.
*   **Modularity:** The project is well-structured into multiple Rust crates.
*   **gRPC as Primary Interface:** Confirmed.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Confirmed via SDKs.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights (Deepened)

*   The project leverages strong typing and Rust's trait system effectively to create a flexible and extensible payment integration service.
*   The `hyperswitch_interfaces` and other `hyperswitch_*` crates provide significant foundational components and abstractions.
*   Error handling is managed via `error-stack` and custom error types.
*   Macros are used in `connector-integration` to reduce boilerplate for connector implementations.

## 7. Active Local Memory Banks

*   The following Local Memory Banks are now active and have been initialized:
    *   `backend/connector-integration/.cline.mb/`
    *   `backend/grpc-server/.cline.mb/`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/.cline.mb/`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/razorpay/.cline.mb/`
