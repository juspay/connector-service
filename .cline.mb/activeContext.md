# Active Context: Connector Service

## 1. Current Focus

*   **Memory Bank Hierarchy Creation:** Establishing the full hierarchical structure of Memory Banks, including Root and initial Local Memory Banks for key components.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   Created the initial versions of the Root Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   Created Local Memory Banks (including `localContext.md`, `componentPatterns.md`, `componentProgress.md`) for:
    *   `backend/connector-integration/`
    *   `backend/grpc-server/`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/razorpay/`

## 3. Next Steps (Memory Bank Creation)

1.  Update `/.cline.mb/progress.md` to reflect the creation and initial status of these Local Memory Banks.
2.  Review existing project documentation (e.g., `README.md`, files in `docs/`) to enrich both Root and Local Memory Banks.
3.  Begin deeper analysis of the codebase, starting with `Cargo.toml` files for each crate to understand dependencies and relationships.
4.  Populate Local Memory Bank files with specific details derived from code analysis.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The Memory Bank is being built from a "cold start" based on file structure analysis. Content will be refined as direct code/documentation review occurs.
*   The initial Memory Bank files are high-level; details will be filled in progressively.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Emerging)

*   **Modularity:** The project is clearly structured into multiple Rust crates, emphasizing separation of concerns. This pattern should be maintained.
*   **gRPC as Primary Interface:** All external interactions seem to be channeled through gRPC.
*   **Multi-language Support:** The presence of SDKs and examples in various languages is a key feature.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights (Initial)

*   The project is a non-trivial backend service with a focus on payment processing.
*   Rust is the primary backend language.
*   Significant effort has been put into providing client-side integration facilities.

## 7. Active Local Memory Banks

*   The following Local Memory Banks are now active and have been initialized:
    *   `backend/connector-integration/.cline.mb/`
    *   `backend/grpc-server/.cline.mb/`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/adyen/.cline.mb/`
    *   `backend/connector-integration/src/connectors/razorpay/.cline.mb/`
