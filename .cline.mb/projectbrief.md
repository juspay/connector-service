# Project Brief: Connector Service

## 1. Project Overview

This project, "connector-service," appears to be a backend system designed to integrate with various payment connectors. The primary goal is to provide a unified interface for processing payments through multiple payment gateways.

## 2. Core Requirements

*   **Multiple Connector Integration:** Support for various payment providers (e.g., Adyen, Razorpay).
*   **Unified API:** Offer a consistent API for initiating and managing payments, regardless of the underlying connector.
*   **gRPC Interface:** Expose functionality via gRPC, as indicated by `proto` files and gRPC server components.
*   **Extensibility:** Allow for the addition of new payment connectors with relative ease.
*   **SDKs/Examples:** Provide client libraries or examples for various programming languages (Node.js, Python, Rust, Haskell) to facilitate integration.

## 3. Key Goals

*   Simplify payment gateway integration for client applications.
*   Provide a robust and scalable payment processing backend.
*   Maintain clear separation of concerns between the core service and individual connector logic.

## 4. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Payment processing (authorization, capture, refunds, etc. - to be confirmed).
    *   Webhook handling (inferred from typical payment system needs).
    *   Connector lifecycle management.
    *   API for payment operations.
    *   Health checks for service monitoring.
*   **Out of Scope (Assumed, to be confirmed):**
    *   User interface/dashboard for managing payments (unless specified).
    *   Direct merchant onboarding features.
    *   Complex fraud detection systems (beyond what connectors provide).

## 5. Stakeholders (Assumed)

*   Development teams building applications that require payment processing.
*   Operations teams responsible for maintaining the payment infrastructure.

*(This is an initial draft. Further details will be added as the project context is explored.)*
