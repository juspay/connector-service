# Project Progress: Connector Service

## 1. Overall Project Status

*   **Phase:** Detailed Analysis
*   **Current State:** Root and Local Memory Banks reviewed and updated. Project documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`) read. `Cargo.toml` files for core crates analyzed to understand dependencies. Directory structures of key `src` directories reviewed. Key files from `domain_types`, `connector-integration` (including `adyen.rs` and `adyen/transformers.rs`), `grpc-server` (including `payments.rs`), and `external-services` have been read to understand a typical Payment Authorization flow.
*   **Next Major Goal:** Continue deeper code-level analysis of other critical flows (e.g., Refunds, Webhooks) and populate Local Memory Banks with more specific details.

## 2. Component Status (High-Level)

## 3. What Works (Confirmed from Analysis)

*   Well-structured multi-crate Rust workspace.
*   Clear gRPC API definitions and implementation via `tonic`.
*   Robust domain type definitions and trait-based abstractions for connectors.
*   A generic mechanism (`execute_connector_processing_step`) for handling connector interactions.
*   Specific connector implementations (e.g., Adyen) with detailed data transformers.
*   SDKs and examples for multiple languages.
*   Docker setup for containerization.

## 4. What's Left to Build / Understand (From MB Perspective)

*   Detailed logic for other payment flows (Refunds, Captures, Voids, Webhooks) across different connectors.
*   Specifics of error handling and reporting in various scenarios.
*   Full details of configuration options and their impact.
*   Deployment strategy and operational aspects (detailed logging, metrics usage).
*   The exact role and implementation details of the `checkout` connector.

## 5. Known Issues (Project Level)

*   None identified yet from a Memory Bank perspective. Will be populated based on code review, existing issue trackers, or user input.

## 6. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   *(To be filled in as the project's history and rationale behind key decisions are understood.)*

*(This file will be updated as components are analyzed and their progress becomes clearer.)*
