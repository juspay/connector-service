# Project Progress: Connector Service

## 1. Overall Project Status

*   **Phase:** Initial Setup & Discovery
*   **Current State:** Foundational Root Memory Bank created. Project structure analyzed at a high level. Code and detailed documentation review pending.
*   **Next Major Goal:** Populate Memory Bank with details from `README.md`, `docs/`, and `Cargo.toml` files. Then, begin code-level analysis of key crates.

## 2. Component Status (High-Level)

This section will track the development status, known issues, and planned work for major components. Initially, this will be based on inferences from the file structure.

## 3. What Works (Inferred from Structure)

*   Basic project scaffolding for a multi-crate Rust workspace.
*   gRPC API definitions seem to be in place.
*   Structure for multiple payment connectors exists.
*   SDKs and examples for multiple languages are provided.
*   Docker setup for containerization.

## 4. What's Left to Build / Understand (From MB Perspective)

*   Detailed understanding of each crate's functionality.
*   Specific logic within each payment connector.
*   Data flow through the system.
*   Error handling strategies.
*   Configuration options and their impact.
*   Deployment strategy (beyond Dockerfile).
*   Operational aspects (logging, metrics).

## 5. Known Issues (Project Level)

*   None identified yet from a Memory Bank perspective. Will be populated based on code review, existing issue trackers, or user input.

## 6. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   *(To be filled in as the project's history and rationale behind key decisions are understood.)*

*(This file will be updated as components are analyzed and their progress becomes clearer.)*
