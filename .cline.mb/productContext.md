# Product Context: Connector Service

## 1. Problem Solved

Integrating with multiple payment gateways is a complex and time-consuming task for businesses. Each gateway has its own API, authentication mechanisms, data formats, and operational nuances. This project aims to solve this problem by:

*   **Abstracting Complexity:** Providing a single, unified API that hides the specific details of each payment connector.
*   **Reducing Integration Effort:** Allowing developers to write code once to support multiple payment providers.
*   **Streamlining Maintenance:** Centralizing connector logic, making it easier to update, manage, and troubleshoot integrations.
*   **Enhancing Flexibility:** Enabling businesses to easily switch between or add new payment providers without significant rework of their core application logic.

## 2. How It Should Work (High-Level)

The Connector Service should act as an intermediary between client applications and various payment gateways.

1.  **Client Request:** A client application (e.g., e-commerce platform, subscription service) initiates a payment-related request (e.g., create payment, process refund) to the Connector Service's API.
2.  **Request Routing:** The service identifies the target payment connector based on the request parameters or pre-configured routing rules.
3.  **Data Transformation:** The service transforms the incoming request data into the format expected by the specific payment connector.
4.  **Connector Interaction:** The service communicates with the selected payment gateway's API to perform the requested operation.
5.  **Response Handling:** The service receives the response from the payment gateway.
6.  **Data Normalization:** The service transforms the connector-specific response into a standardized format.
7.  **Client Response:** The service sends a unified response back to the client application.
8.  **Webhook Handling (Asynchronous Operations):** The service should be capable of receiving, processing, and relaying asynchronous notifications (webhooks) from payment gateways to the appropriate client applications.

## 3. User Experience Goals

*   **For Developers (Primary Users):**
    *   **Ease of Integration:** Clear, well-documented API and SDKs.
    *   **Consistency:** Predictable behavior and data formats across all connectors.
    *   **Reliability:** Robust error handling and clear feedback.
    *   **Testability:** Easy to mock or test integrations.
*   **For End-Users (Indirectly):**
    *   Seamless and reliable payment experiences.
    *   Support for preferred payment methods.
*   **For Operators/Admins:**
    *   **Monitorability:** Clear logs, metrics, and health check endpoints.
    *   **Configurability:** Easy to add, configure, and manage connectors.

## 4. Key Features (Derived from Goals & How it Works)

*   Payment creation, authorization, capture, void, and refund.
*   Payment method management (e.g., tokenization, if applicable).
*   Subscription/recurring payment support (if in scope).
*   Standardized error handling and reporting.
*   Secure management of connector credentials.
*   Webhook ingestion and forwarding.
*   Health check endpoints for service monitoring.
